the NY-map.py contains the dashboard that was mainly written using dash, plotly and pandas.
the dataclean jupyter notebook contains all the cleaning that was done on the Airbnb open data dataset, it also contains the cleaning and addition of our auxiliary dataset (originally titled 'bar_locations.csv').
It returns a file called 'superclean.csv' located in the datasets directory.




The "scraps" directory contains individual implementation of certain parts of the dashboard (e.g. violin plot).
